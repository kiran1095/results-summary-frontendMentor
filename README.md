## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media Queries to support responsiveness.

### What I learned

    - Got better understanding with usage of media queries and css Flexbox.

### Continued development

    - Got better at using width and measurement units to support responsiveness, but still think I need more practise at using measurements like rem, vh, etc., to support better responsiveness.
